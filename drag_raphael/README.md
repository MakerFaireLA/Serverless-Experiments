# Serverless-Experiments/drag_raphael

This experiment is my first attempt to experiment with drag-and-drop in Raphael.  Turned out great.

I am considering replacing Processing/p5 with Raphael.  Processing is intended for beginners and is not well 
targeted for our needs.  Raphael provides an object model with robust user event trapping that will be 
quite useful to us.

It is no longer necessary to install Raphael.  With the current setup your browser will now download it 
from a cdn server.
