# draggable_object

Experimenting with making objects that can be dragged around with the mouse
in Processing/p5.  Turned out pretty satisfactorily.

Basic structure came from a YouTube video:
6.7: Clicking on Objects - p5.js Tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEHsr4XicN8
which I then adapted to get the dragging effect I was looking for.

This experiment does not cover how to handle overlapping objects at all,
and I DO expect that this will be an issue, nor does it make use of the far 
more advanced browser or native OS libraries that I wish we could link 
against, but my goal for the day was to get an object I could drag around
and at least now we have one.
